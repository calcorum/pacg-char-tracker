#Pathfinder Adventure Card Game Character Tracker

This is the new home of the PACG Character Tracker app for Android. The project was previously published via Boardgamegeek [here](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1026770/character-tracker-android-app/page/1). Updates will still be published there.


## To Install:
Download the PACGCharacterTracker.apk file in the "app" folder and install on your Android device. You will need to have Unknown Sources enabled. A quick internet search for "(my device) Unknown Sources" should show you how to do that.
