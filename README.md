#Pathfinder Adventure Card Game Character Tracker

This is the new home of the PACG Character Tracker app for Android. The project was previously published via Boardgamegeek [here](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1026770/character-tracker-android-app/page/1). Updates will still be published there.


## To Install:
The following instructions will be true as soon as this repo is updated with the current source code and the .apk installer file is uploaded. Please be patient! I am picking this project back up from Q1 2014 so I need to get caught up.

~~Download the PACGCharacterTracker.apk file in the root directory and install on your Android device. You will need to have Unknown Sources enabled. A quick internet search for "<my device> Unknown Sources" should show you how to do that.~~
